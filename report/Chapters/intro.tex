Recently, there has been a revival in the usage of deep
learning\cite{lecun2015deep} techniques, allowing for large advances across
a number of fields including image recognition\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet},
speech recognition\cite{graves2013speech, hinton2012deep}. Similarly,
there has been recent advancements in the area of reinforcement learning,
where intelligent agents have been able to complete tasks that were once thought
to be too complex for an agent to complete, such as beating humans in the game
Go\cite{silver2016mastering} and more generally such as across a wide range of
Atari 2600 games\cite{mnih2015human}. However, despite these recent advancements,
there are still a number challenges that prove difficult for current reinforcement
learning algorithms, which has lead DeepMind\cite{deepmind} to developing the
StarCraft II Learning Environment\cite{pysc2}, a Python environment for interfacing
with the game StarCraft II\cite{vinyals2017starcraft, starcraft2}.
This game was chosen as it involves a number of areas that current reinforcement learning
algorithms struggle with, including partial observation, a large action space, control
of multiple units and the reward is delayed across thousands of steps, meaning the agent
needs to use long-term strategies.
