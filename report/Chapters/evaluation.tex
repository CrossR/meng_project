\chapter{Performance Evaluation}%
\label{eval}

This chapter, the performance of both of the networks outlined in
Chapter~\ref{implem} will be evaluated, such that their performance at playing
the game StarCraft II can be measured. The exact methodology for these tests is
described in Chapter~\ref{eval_method}.

Each section will be split into three, first evaluating the Deep Q network,
second the Convolutional network, and then finally comparing the two.
After this has been done for both the mini-games and the Simple64 map, the
results will compared overall to see what the advantages and disadvantages of
each network is, as well as comparing other parts of the networks such as
training time, and robustness.

Finally, before the conclusion, some of the additional parts of the trained
networks which are not directly linked to the performance of the network, but
do give insight into how the networks works will be shown. For example the
filters for the Convolutional network will be given here, as well as some
example outputs.
