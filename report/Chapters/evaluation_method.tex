\section{Datasets}

The two agent types will be tested on two different sets of datasets.
These are the DeepMind mini-games, as well as the Simple64 map. These two
datasets should give an overall idea of how the agent is performing.

\subsection{Mini-games}

The mini-games consist of small, constrained challenges that represent
small parts of the full game of StarCraft II, allowing simple actions
in the game to be tested, as well as compared against a range of
published scores.

Every mini-game has a time limit, and the objective is to get the
highest score possible in the time frame. The scores for the game are surfaced
as part of the SC2LE \texttt{obs} object, meaning the agent is capable of easily
telling how well it is doing, and learning from this reward.

These mini-games are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item MoveToBeacon: A simple map with a single marine (player controlled
        unit) and a beacon, which acts as a target to move to. The agent gets
        a point each time it reaches the beacon, at which point the beacon's
        location is reset.
    \item CollectMineralShards: A map with two marines and 20 mineral shards,
        which act as items to pick up. Once all are picked up, 20 more are
        placed on the map. To achieve an optimum score, the two marines must
        be controlled independently, which results in this map being
        harder than the MoveToBeacon map.
    \item FindAndDefeatZerglings: A map with three marines and 25 zerglings,
        which are an enemy unit. A point is achieved for each zergling that
        is defeated, and a point lost any time a marine dies. This map
        is also the first to deal with the moving of the camera, as the previous
        two games had the entire state visible without moving the camera.
        Upon defeating the 25 zerglings, 25 more are added.
    \item DefeatRoaches: A map with nine marines and four roaches, which are a
        different enemy unit. This requires a more complex strategy to defeat,
        and also on defeating all four roaches, four more are spawned as well as 5
        more marines. This means the number of marines potentially grows
        throughout the game. However, a point is lost for any lost marines.
    \item DefeatZerglingsAndBanelings: A map with nine marines and six zerglings
        and four banelings. This again needs a different strategy and also gives
        extra marines upon defeating all the enemies.
    \item CollectMineralsAndGas: This map requires more strategy than the last.
        The map starts with 12 SCVs (which are gatherer units), a command centre
        (which is used to create additional units) and two types of collectable
        resources. The objective is to gather as many resources as possible, and
        also intelligently build more gathering units to increase the
        speed at which resources are gathered. An optimal strategy will also
        build an additional command centre.
    \item BuildMarines: This is the last and most complex map. The map starts
        with 12 SCVs, a command centre and eight resources to collect. The
        objective is to build as many marines as possible in the time limit.
        This requires the building of Supply Depots to store resources and
        barracks to build marines.
\end{itemize}

All of these mini-games have published scores for the many different
techniques as well as some baseline scores for human players and random
policies. This makes them ideal for testing a model again, such that the scores can
be directly compared.

\subsection{The \textbf{Simple64} Map}

The \textbf{Simple64} map was also chosen to allow experimentation on a
straightforward version of the full game, where the challenge is to beat the
games AI, which is built using more traditional game AI technology, and also can
cheat at higher difficulties.

The map contains a single opponent and two starting bases. The agent is spawned
into one of the two areas randomly and starts out with the \textbf{SCV} units,
characters for building and mining. The initial stage begins with mining of
necessary of resources for progressing through the level by creating the
required buildings and training \textbf{Marines}, fighter characters. This needs
the agent to control the \textbf{SCV} and \textbf{Marine} units using complex
three action commands. The end goal is to defeat the AI player and win the game.

One aspect that makes this much harder is the removal of a simple scoring
element, like that in the mini-games. This means the only scoring methods
available is the win/lose/draw score at the end of the game, of the ``Blizzard''
score that is given throughout, but is based on many different in-game aspects.
This makes it much harder for the agent to directly tell how well it is doing in
the global aspect of the game.

The more obvious element that makes this harder is that it combines all the
tasks that the mini-games cover, as well adding new tasks as the AI player will
attack bases and units, search and take resources, and build units and
buildings, all of which are not covered in the mini-games. This combination of
both new elements and a large number of already known elements makes the simple
64 maps much harder to play.

Due to this map containing a small snippet of the entire game, it will be useful
for measuring how the agent behaves in a general settings, as it is possible for
an agent to excel at each of the underlying tasks that go into a game of
StarCraft II, but to fail in the process of combining them effectively.
