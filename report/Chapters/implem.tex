\section{Environment setup}
Since the game is very complex and can consist of many possible action spaces, the majority of the experimentation focuses on the \textbf{Simle64} map. The map contains a single opponent and 2 starting bases. The agent is spawned into one of the 2 areas randomly and starts out with the \textbf{SCV} units, characters for building and mining. The initial stage begins with mining of necessary of resources for progressing through level by creating the required buildings and training \textbf{Marines}, fighter characters. This requires the agent to control the \textbf{SCV} and \textbf{Marine} units using complex three action commands.
