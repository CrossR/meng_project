\section{Code Repository}
The code used for this project may be found at
\url{https://github.com/CrossR/meng_project}. This does not include the
trained weights for Convolutional network due to a single model being close to
1GB in size. These can be provided upon request however.

\section{Used Materials}
As part of the project, we made use of the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item StarCraft II --- \url{https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto}
    \item The PySC2 API --- \url{https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2}
    \item TensorFlow --- \url{https://www.tensorflow.org/}
    \item Initial Q Learning Agent --- Used for initial Q Learning Agent ---
        \url{https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow}
    \item Convolutional Agent Flags --- Used for initial convolutional agent
        flags ---\url{https://github.com/xhujoy/pysc2-agents/blob/master/main.py}
    \item Convolutional Agent Initial Design --- Based on DeepMind's
        implementation, and modified from a recreation ---
        \url{https://github.com/pekaalto/sc2aibot}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Ethical Issues Addressed}
The project aimed to create a specialised AI designed to solve an artificial
problem with no direct real-world applications.
No specific ethical concerns need to be addressed or were within the scope of the
project.
